# This is a file that runs the miz_correction script
#
# Here we are using all of the miz_correction flags in order to
# calculate the correction to the absorption energy for a file
# named NaGe on a core hole on a Ge atom. We have previously done
# a singlepoint calculation (files not shown) to determine that the 
# E-TS groundstate energy is -106903.51336456 and are using that as 
# our groundstate energy. The executable we are using is called 
# castep.serial and is on our $PATH. This will run a castep
# DRYRUN calculation and then write a file called NaGe-mizoguchi.out
# Which has all the details of the calculation including if it failed
# 
# The singlepoint energy of -6350.174255159 eV is calculated from a 
# singlepoint calculation without a charge and without a core hole
# on the same cell as in NaGe.cell
